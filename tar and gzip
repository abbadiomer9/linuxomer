The tar command can pack single files or all files in a directory tree into one file, which can be unpacked later.

```bash
tar -cvf myfiles.tar mytree file1 file2
```

c: pack
v: list name of files
f: pack into file

```bash
tar -xvf myfiles.tar
```

x:extract


Compress with gzip:

```bash
gzip mytar.tar
```
