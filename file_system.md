In Linux, files are arranged into directories (analogous to folders in Windows). 
The root directory is simply referred to as "/."
Users' files are stored in their home folders, which are located in "/home/." For instance, "/home/adam/."

<h2>Special directory names</h2> 

* “./” is a reference to the current directory;
* “../” is a reference  to the directory one level above the current directory; 
* “~/” is a reference  to your home directory.

<h2>File names</h2> 
Unlike Windows, Linux distinguishes between upper and lower case letters in file names.
That is, the file names "Test," "TEST," and "test" all refer to distinct files.

<h2>Hidden files</h2> 
Hidden files have filenames that begin with “.” (period). 
These are generally system files that do not appear when you list the contents of a directory. 

<h2>Permissions</h2>
Files are given "permissions" that specify who has access to them and what kind of access they have.
The three most basic forms of access are read, write, and execute. 
You can read the content of a file (e.g., make your own copy) if you have read access. 
You can remove, edit, or replace files with write access.
Execute access is necessary to run programs or access the contents of folders.
