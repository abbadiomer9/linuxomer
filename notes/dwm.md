## Dynamic Window Manager (DWM)

The Dynamic Window Manager (DWM) is a minimal, lightweight, and highly efficient tiling window manager designed to help you manage application windows in a clean and distraction-free manner. Instead of overlapping windows as seen in traditional window managers, DWM organizes windows in a tiled layout, making it easy to see and navigate multiple applications simultaneously. DWM is based on the X Window System, making it suitable for use on Unix-like operating systems.

DWM stands out for its extreme simplicity and high customization capability. It is part of the suckless software philosophy, which emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and resource efficiency.

Here's how DWM looks in action. Each window takes a portion of the screen, allowing for easy multitasking.

## Installation

Installation of DWM is straightforward. If you're on a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu or Mint, you can install DWM and its related suckless-tools packages using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install dwm suckless-tools
```

The suckless-tools package contains additional utilities developed by the suckless community, including dmenu, a fast and lightweight dynamic menu for X, and slock, a simple screen locker utility.

After installation, you can choose DWM as your window manager from the login screen.

Remember that DWM is highly customizable, but changes typically require modifying the source code and recompiling. So if you're up for some tinkering, you can clone the DWM source code from the suckless website, make changes to suit your needs, and then build and install your custom version of DWM.

## Usage

After installing DWM, you primarily interact with it through keyboard shortcuts, which are much quicker and more efficient than using a mouse in a tiling window manager environment. Here's a list of the basic DWM commands and shortcuts you'll use to manage windows and tags:

* **Spawn a new terminal:** Open a new terminal by pressing `Shift + Alt + Enter`. This is typically bound to spawn the `st` terminal or `xterm` if `st` is not installed.

* **Switch between windows:** To move your focus between different windows, use `Alt + j` and `Alt + k`. These commands cycle your focus through the windows in the currently visible tag.

* **Change window position:** To promote a window from the stack to the master area (and vice versa), press `Alt + Enter`.

* **Close a window:** To close the currently focused window, you could click the close button or type `exit` and press `Enter` in terminal windows.

* **Switch between tags:** DWM uses tags (similar to virtual desktops or workspaces). To switch your view to another tag, press `Alt + [tag number]`. Tag numbers are from 1 to 9.

* **Log out:** When you want to quit DWM, press `Shift + Alt + q`. This will close the window manager and return you to your display manager or console.

* **Move window to another tag:** If you want to move a window to another tag, first focus on the window, then press `Shift + Alt + [tag number]`.

* **Toggle window between tiled and floating modes:** If you need a window to float above the tiled layout, focus on it and press `Alt + t`. Press the same shortcut to return the window to the tiled layout.

* **Resize a floating window:** You can resize a floating window by holding `Alt`, then right-clicking and dragging the window.

* **Move a floating window:** Similarly, you can move a floating window by holding `Alt`, then left-clicking and dragging the window.

Remember that one of the beauties of DWM is its customizability, so you're not limited to these defaults. If you're comfortable with C programming, you can edit `config.h`, recompile, and reinstall DWM to change the bindings to your liking.

## Configuration

Unlike other window managers that use configuration files, DWM is customized by directly modifying its source code and then recompiling it. This approach provides a lot of flexibility and control over DWM's behavior and appearance. The main configuration is located in the `config.h` file, which can be found in the DWM source code directory.

Follow these steps to customize DWM to your preferences:

1. **Download the DWM source code:** You can clone the source code from the official suckless git repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
```

2. **Navigate to the dwm directory and create a config.h file**: The config.def.h file contains the default settings. To customize DWM, you should first copy config.def.h to config.h. Then, you can edit the config.h file with your preferred text editor (e.g., nano, vim, emacs). Here's how to do that:

```bash
cd dwm
cp config.def.h config.h
nano config.h
```

3. **Customize the config.h file**: In the config.h file, you can change various settings according to your preferences. For example, you can modify key bindings, set custom colors, define the status bar's appearance, and select the default font. Save your changes and exit the text editor when you're finished.

4. **Compile and install the modified DWM**: After modifying the config.h file, you need to compile the DWM source code and install the new binary:

```bash
sudo make clean install
```

5. **Apply the changes**: Log out and log back in, or restart your X session to apply the changes. The updated DWM should now be in effect.
