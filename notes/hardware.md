## Hardware and Linux

### Compatibility

Linux works well with most new hardware, but some old or uncommon hardware might need extra drivers or settings.

### Hardware Architecture

Linux supports many hardware architectures like x86, ARM, and PowerPC, making it great for embedded systems, servers, and special hardware.

### Accessing Hardware in Linux

Access hardware using device files in the /dev folder. These files represent the hardware devices and can be accessed with system calls and tools.

### Managing Hardware in Linux

Use commands to check hardware information. These commands can be split into groups:

#### Internal Hardware Information

* `lsusb`: shows USB devices, vendor and product ID, manufacturer, and product name.
* `lspci`: shows PCI devices, vendor and device ID, class, and function.
* `lsdev`: shows devices known to the system, device type, device name, and device driver.
* `lsblk`: shows block devices, device name, size, and type.
* `lscpu`: shows CPU information, processor architecture, number of CPUs, number of cores, and more.

#### Plugged Devices Information

* `dmesg`: shows kernel ring buffer with messages from the kernel and device drivers. It helps to see information about plugged devices and other system events.

### Linux Hardware Drivers

Linux comes with many built-in drivers for common hardware. Some hardware needs proprietary drivers, which can be found on the manufacturer's website or through third-party repositories.

### Monitoring Hardware

Monitor hardware health, temperature, and performance using tools like:

* `sensors`: shows temperature sensors, fan speeds, and voltage information.
* `hddtemp`: shows hard drive temperature.
* `iotop`: shows disk I/O usage by processes.
* `iftop`: shows network bandwidth usage by connections.

### Troubleshooting Hardware Issues

Diagnose hardware problems using tools like:

* `smartctl`: checks hard drive health using SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology).
* `badblocks`: scans for bad sectors on a hard drive.
* `memtest86`: tests memory for errors.

To learn about commands and their options, check the man pages or use the `--help` option.
