## Ports

Ports are integral to the functioning of computer networks, acting as endpoints in the communication process between devices. They can be visualized as doors through which data enters or exits a computer.

### Key Facts

- **Total Ports**: There are 65,536 ports, ranging from 0 to 65,535.
- **Port Types**: Ports can be classified as:
  - **Well-Known Ports**: Range from 0 to 1023 and are used by widely-recognized services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
  - **Registered Ports**: Range from 1024 to 49,151 and are less commonly used.
  - **Dynamic/Private Ports**: Range from 49,152 to 65,535 and are typically used for private purposes.
  
### Protocols Using Ports
Computers use multiple protocols to communicate over the internet, and the two most prominent are:
  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
  - **Features**: Reliable, connection-oriented.
  - **Drawbacks**: Potentially more vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.
  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
  - **Features**: Connectionless, often faster because it doesn't establish a formal connection.
  - **Drawbacks**: Less reliable than TCP since it doesn't guarantee data delivery.

### Common Services and Their Ports

Several standard services are associated with specific ports:

- **HTTP (Websites)**: Typically uses port 80.
- **HTTPS (Secure Websites)**: Typically uses port 443.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Port 21 for command control and port 20 for data.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Typically uses port 22.

### Port Statuses

Ports can have various statuses, but the most common ones are:

- **Open**: This status means the port is actively accepting incoming connections.
- **Closed**: Ports in this state reject all connections.
- **Filtered**: This state indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall, making it hard to determine if it's open or closed.

### Security Considerations

For security reasons, it's advisable to:

- **Close Unused Ports**: Leaving ports open without a specific purpose can make systems vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks.
- **Regularly Monitor Port Activity**: Using tools like `netstat` or `lsof`, one can monitor which ports are active and what applications are using them.

### Identify the Process Associated with a Specific Port

In network management and security assessments, understanding which processes are binding to specific ports is crucial. For instance, you might need to verify that the intended service is running on its designated port or to diagnose port conflicts. The `lsof` (List Open Files) command, combined with certain flags, can help identify which process is using a specific port.

#### Using the `lsof` Command:

Find Processes Using a Specific Port:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :<port-number>
```

For instance, to see which process is using port 80:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
```

This will return a list of processes bound to port 80. The output includes essential details like the process name, user running the process, the associated PID (Process ID), and more.

If you want a more concise output showing just the PID, process name, and the user running the process, use:

``` bash
sudo lsof -i :<port-number> -n -P | awk 'NR==1 || /LISTEN/ {print $2, $1, $3}'
```

Replace `<port-number>` with the desired port number. This version filters out the non-listening states and formats the output for clarity.

#### Using netstat

In systems where lsof might not be available, the netstat command, combined with grep, can also help in identifying processes associated with ports:

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :<port-number>
```

Always be cautious about unexpected processes binding to known ports. Such anomalies could indicate misconfigurations or potential security threats, like backdoors or unauthorized services.

## Socket Status

In networking, a socket represents an endpoint for sending or receiving data. When a program wants to communicate over the Internet, it creates a socket. To monitor these sockets and the status of their connections, we can use the `ss` (socket status) tool, which is a utility to investigate sockets. This tool is especially helpful for understanding current network configurations, active/inactive connections, and diagnosing various network-related issues.

### Key Commands

Below are some fundamental `ss` commands to view different socket details:

- **Display All Active Connections**:

```
ss -tuln
```

This command lists all UDP and TCP connections, without resolving hostnames (due to `-n`).

- **Display Only TCP Ports**:

```
ss -tln
```

This restricts the output to only TCP connections and avoids resolving hostnames.

- **Display Only UDP Ports**:
  
```
ss -uln
```

This shows just the UDP connections, also without resolving hostnames.

- **Display Listening Sockets**:

```
ss -tuln state listening
```

This will display all listening TCP and UDP sockets.

- **Display Established Connections**:

```
ss -tuln state established
```

This focuses on showing only the established connections, helping you identify active data exchanges.

### Filtering the Output:

`ss` can be combined with other command-line utilities for more specific results:

- **Count Active TCP Connections**:

```
ss -tan | grep ESTAB | wc -l
```

This sequence counts the number of established TCP connections.

- **List All SSH Connections**:

```
ss -tan state established '( dport = :22 or sport = :22 )'
```

If you're specifically interested in SSH connections, this command is handy.

## Exploring Nmap: The Network Mapper

Nmap, short for "Network Mapper," is a revered tool in the cybersecurity and network administration arenas. Its primary purpose is to scan IP networks for host discovery, port scanning, and service identification.

### Key Features:

- **Host Discovery**: Find which hosts are available on a network.
- **Port Scanning**: Determine which ports are open on those hosts.
- **Version Detection**: Detect services and their versions running on open ports.
- **OS Detection**: Determine the operating system and its version on a host.

### Common Scenarios for Using Nmap:

- **Security Audits**:
  Network administrators use Nmap to identify open ports that could be potential security vulnerabilities. 

- **Network Inventory**:
  Companies might use Nmap for regular inventory checks, discovering devices on a network, and the services they run.

- **Network Troubleshooting**:
  Determine unreachable hosts, closed ports, or service disruptions.

- **Penetration Testing**:
  Ethical hackers and penetration testers employ Nmap to gather intelligence about a target, which aids in crafting sophisticated attacks.

### Basic Nmap Commands:

1. **Scan a Single Host**:

```
nmap <IP-address>
```

Replace `<IP-address>` with the IP of the host you wish to scan.

2. **Scan Multiple Hosts**:

```
nmap <IP-address1,IP-address2,...>
```

Separate the IPs with commas for scanning multiple hosts.

3. **Scan a Range of Hosts**:

```
nmap <IP-address-start>-<IP-address-end>
```

For instance, `nmap 192.168.1.1-20` would scan hosts from `192.168.1.1` through `192.168.1.20`.

4. **Scan a Subnet**:
   
```
nmap <IP-address/CIDR>
```

For instance, `nmap 192.168.1.0/24` would scan all 256 hosts in the `192.168.1.0` subnet.

5. **Fast Scan**:
The `-F` flag makes Nmap scan fewer ports than the default, making the scan faster.

```
nmap -F <IP-address>
```

### Considerations:

- **Permission**: Always seek permission before scanning a network. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and lead to severe consequences.

- **Stealth**: Some scans can be noisy and alert intrusion detection systems. Be aware of the type of scans you're conducting, especially in sensitive environments.

- **Output Formats**: Nmap allows you to save scan results in various formats (normal, XML, s|<rIpt kIddi3, and grepable) for easier parsing and sharing.

- **Extensions and GUI**: Nmap has a graphical version called Zenmap, which provides a user-friendly interface. Additionally, NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) allows users to write scripts to automate a wide range of networking tasks.
