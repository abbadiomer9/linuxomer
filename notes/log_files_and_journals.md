# Log Files, Journals, and Logging Systems

Logging is a crucial part of managing Linux systems. It helps you keep track of essential events, troubleshoot problems, and maintain smooth system operation. Linux offers various logging methods, like text files, `Journald`, and `Rsyslog`. Each has unique benefits and limitations.

## Different Logging Methods

Linux systems offer a range of logging methods:

* **Text files**: The simplest logging method, text files store information in plain text format. Sysadmins can store any data they want in these files, offering them full control.

* **Journald**: `Journald` is used by systemd-based systems and stores information about the boot process, services, and kernel in binary files. These files aren't meant for long-term storage, as they're designed to be rotated and deleted when no longer needed.

* **Rsyslog**: This method redirects log files to the `/var/log` directory, where logs are stored persistently for longer periods.

## System Log Files

Linux systems store log files in the `/var/log` directory. Here are some common log files:

1. **syslog**: A centralized logging system containing messages related to the kernel, applications, and more.
2. **kern.log**: Stores kernel-related messages like hardware events, driver issues, and system errors.
3. **auth.log**: Records authentication and authorization events, such as user logins, password changes, and privilege escalations.
4. **dmesg**: Contains messages related to the kernel ring buffer, useful for diagnosing hardware and driver issues during system startup.

## Journal Files

`systemd` is the default system and service manager for many Linux distributions. It uses a centralized logging system called the journal, which stores log data in binary format. The journal provides advanced features like indexing, data integrity, and compression.

To view journal entries, use the `journalctl` command. By default, it displays all journal entries chronologically:

```bash
journalctl
```

You can use various options to filter and display journal entries, such as:

- `-u, --unit`: Show log entries for a specific unit (e.g., a service).
- `-b, --boot`: Show log entries from the current boot.
- `--since`, `--until`: Show log entries between specific dates and times.
- `-f, --follow`: Continuously display new log entries as they are added to the journal.

For example, to view log entries for the `ssh.service` unit, run:

```
journalctl -u ssh.service
```

## Rsyslog

Rsyslog is a high-performance log processing system designed for flexibility and scalability. It has a modular design, excellent performance, and strong security features. Originally developed as a simple syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a powerful logging tool capable of receiving input from various sources, processing it, and sending the output to multiple destinations.

For example, rsyslog can be used to collect logs from multiple machines in a network and store them in a centralized location for analysis. This is particularly useful in large-scale deployments, where tracking logs from individual machines becomes challenging.

The primary configuration file for rsyslog is located at `/etc/rsyslog.conf`. Be aware that editing this file can be complex, as it uses its own scripting language. To set up rsyslog, you can define rulesets for different log sources, specify input and output modules, and apply filters based on severity levels or other criteria.

### Severity Levels

Severity levels are used to categorize log messages based on their importance. These levels range from 0 (emerg) to 7 (debug), as shown in the table below:

| Code | Severity |  Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | emerg | system is unusable |
| 1 | alert | action must be taken immediately |
| 2 | crit | critical conditions |
| 3 | error | error conditions |
| 4 | warning | warning conditions |
| 5 | notice | normal but significant condition |
| 6 | info | informational messages |
| 7 | debug | debug-level messages |

Using severity levels, you can filter log messages to display only relevant information or route specific messages to particular destinations, such as email or a dedicated log server.

### Example scenario

Consider a scenario where you have multiple servers in a network, and you want to collect all the logs in a centralized location for easier monitoring and analysis. You can achieve this by configuring rsyslog on both the log-collecting server (centralized logging server) and the client machines that generate logs.

Setting up the rsyslog server:

Install rsyslog on the server machine if it's not already installed:

```
sudo apt-get install rsyslog
```

Edit the rsyslog configuration file at `/etc/rsyslog.conf`. Uncomment the following lines to enable the server to listen for incoming logs on UDP port 514:

```
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")
```

Restart rsyslog to apply the changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

(Optional) Configure the firewall to allow incoming connections on UDP port 514:

```
sudo ufw allow 514/udp
```

Setting up the rsyslog client:

Install rsyslog on the client machine if it's not already installed:

```
sudo apt-get install rsyslog
```

Edit the rsyslog configuration file at /etc/rsyslog.conf. Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing <SERVER_IP> with the IP address of the rsyslog server:

```
*.* @<SERVER_IP>:514
```

This line instructs the client to forward all log messages (*.*) to the rsyslog server over UDP.

Restart rsyslog to apply the changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

Now, the client machines will forward their log messages to the centralized rsyslog server. The server will store the logs in the `/var/log` directory. You can analyze these logs using various log analysis tools, or filter and process them using rsyslog's scripting language.

## Logger

Logger is a command-line utility used to add logs to the local `/var/log/syslog` file or a remote syslog server. It offers several options for adding logs, like selecting the priority, specifying a remote system, and defining the syslog port.

For more information on logger, you can use the man pages:

```
man logger
```

A simple example of using logger is:

```
logger "An example of log message"
```

To send a log message to a remote server using logger, you can use the following command:

```
logger -n 192.168.10.27 -P 1420 "An example of log message"
```

Here, the `-n` flag specifies the IP address of the remote syslog server, and the `-P` flag specifies the port number.

## Logrotate

Logrotate is a utility that automates the process of rotating, compressing, and managing log files. If left unchecked, log files can consume all available disk space on a system, causing performance issues or even rendering the system unusable.

Logrotate helps maintain disk space by periodically rotating log files, compressing old logs, and pruning logs beyond a specified threshold. This process ensures that disk space is used efficiently and that logs remain manageable.

To check the version of logrotate installed on your system, use the following command:

```
logrotate --version
```

Logrotate uses configuration files to define the rotation and management policies for specific log files or sets of log files. The main configuration file is located at `/etc/logrotate.conf`, but you can also create additional configuration files for individual applications in the `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory.

For example, you might have a web server generating access and error logs daily. Over time, these logs can grow large and become difficult to manage. Using logrotate, you can configure the system to rotate logs every day, compress logs older than a week, and delete logs older than a month. This setup ensures that you have access to recent logs while still keeping disk usage in check.

Here's a sample logrotate configuration for the web server scenario:

```
/var/log/httpd/*log {
daily
compress
missingok
notifempty
rotate 30
create 0640 root adm
postrotate
/sbin/service httpd reload > /dev/null 2>/dev/null || true
endscript
}
```

In this example, logrotate is configured to rotate and compress the web server logs daily, keep logs for 30 days, and reload the web server after rotating the logs.

By understanding how to use rsyslog and logrotate, you can effectively manage log files on your Linux system and ensure that critical information is preserved while maintaining disk space.

## Journald for systemd based systems

Journald is responsible for event logging on systemd-based systems. It records events from log files, kernel messages, and other sources.

To display the man pages for journald, you can use the following command:

```
man systemd-journald
```

By default, journald is volatile, meaning that its logs are not stored persistently. To make journald persistent, you can uncomment the following line in the configuration file: `'# Storage=auto'`. This file can be found at `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`.

To display the last 10 lines of journald logs, you can use the following command:

```
journalctl -n
```

To display the last 10 lines of journald logs and follow them as they are added in real-time, you can use the following command:

```
journalctl -f
```

To display the short status of a specific service, you can use the following command:

```
systemctl status sshd
```

To display journald logs by priority, you can use the following command:

```
journalctl -p err
```

This will display only logs with a priority of "err" or higher. You can also use other priority levels, such as "warning" or "notice", to filter the logs displayed.
