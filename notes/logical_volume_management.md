## Disk Partitions and Volumes

Think of data storage devices, such as DVDs, USB flash drives, and hard drives (HDDs or SSDs), as an entire cake. This cake can be cut into smaller slices or 'partitions'. These partitions are essentially divisions or sections within the storage device, helping to categorize or organize the storage for diverse uses. For instance, you can segregate different file types or even run multiple operating systems in separate partitions. The structure and arrangement of these partitions resemble a table, which you'd use to keep track of everything.

Just as a cake is divided into partitions, a bookshelf is divided into sections known as 'volumes'. A volume is analogous to a book genre section on a bookshelf, each having its own file system or a method of organizing files. While a partition is limited to a single disk (although that disk can have multiple partitions), a volume has the capability to span across several disks. This is similar to joining several bookshelves to create more space for your books. For instance, you might have a hard drive partitioned into three parts: one for your operating system, one for your personal documents, and a third for your multimedia files. However, if you need extra space for larger files, such as videos, you can create a volume that spans multiple devices to distribute the storage.

## Logical Volume Manager (LVM)

The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a robust tool for managing disk storage on Linux-based systems. It allows the creation of 'logical volumes' that can be readily resized, relocated, and expanded. This introduces a level of flexibility as it facilitates the addition of storage space to your system without the need for additional physical disks. Furthermore, LVM allows for the creation of 'volume snapshots', which are extremely valuable for creating backups of your data.

Despite its advantages, using LVM can make the system setup process more complex, as it requires additional support from the kernel. In certain circumstances, repair images might not be compatible with LVM-based systems. This means it is essential to consider the potential complexity and support issues before deciding to use LVM in a Linux environment.

## Understanding the Components of the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)

LVM comprises several fundamental components, which include:

* **Physical Volumes (PV)**: These are your actual storage devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs).
* **Volume Groups (VG)**: These are collections of physical volumes that can be managed as a single entity.
* **Logical Volumes (LV)**: These are the storage sections within volume groups. A logical volume can be assigned a file system and mounted for use.

Let's understand these components with an analogy. Think of a physical volume as a book, a volume group as a bookshelf containing several books, and a logical volume as a chapter in a book.

This diagram illustrates that:

- Logical Volume Management (LVM) provides a flexible way to manage disk storage by abstracting physical storage into logical volumes.
- A physical volume (PV) refers to a physical disk or partition that is used in an LVM setup, allowing for the aggregation of multiple storage devices.
- In the given example, there are three physical volumes, each with different sizes: **/dev/sdb is 50GB**, **/dev/sdc is 100GB**, and **/dev/sdd is 150GB**.
- These physical volumes are combined into a single volume group (VG), named **TEST**, which aggregates their total storage capacity.
- The total size of the volume group **TEST** is **300GB**, which is the sum of the capacities of the physical volumes.
- Logical volumes (LVs) are created within the volume group, representing virtual partitions that can be resized independently of the underlying physical storage.
- In this scenario, two logical volumes are created within the volume group **TEST**: **vol_name_1**, which has a size of **180GB**, and **vol_name_2**, which has a size of **90GB**.
- The logical volumes are flexible and can be resized or moved across different physical volumes within the volume group, offering ease of management and scalability.
- Unallocated space within the volume group refers to the portion of the total storage capacity that has not been assigned to any logical volume.
- There is **30GB** of unallocated space in the volume group **TEST**, which can be used to extend existing logical volumes or create new ones.

## Creating and Managing LVM Volumes

Creating and managing LVM volumes involve a series of steps that utilize different commands. Here is a brief walkthrough:

I. Creating Physical Volumes

This is the initial step, where you use the `pvcreate` command to set up physical volumes on your disks. This command turns the entire disk into a single LVM physical volume. Here's an example using three devices (`/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, and `/dev/sdd`):

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb
pvcreate /dev/sdc
pvcreate /dev/sdd
```

II. Defining Volume Groups

Next, you create a volume group using the vgcreate command and add your physical volumes to it. The volume group allows you to manage multiple physical volumes as one. Here's an example of creating a volume group named TEST and extending it with additional physical volumes:

```bash
vgcreate TEST /dev/sdb
vgextend TEST /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
```

III. Creating Logical Volumes

After your volume group is set, you can create logical volumes within this group using the `lvcreate` command. These logical volumes will be your actual storage areas. In this example, two logical volumes (`vol_name_1` and `vol_name_2`) of sizes 20GB and 12GB respectively, are created within the TEST volume group:

```bash
lvcreate -L 20G -n vol_name_1 TEST
lvcreate -L 12G -n vol_name_2 TEST
```

IV. Creating a File System on the Logical Volume

Before you can start storing data, you need to create a file system on the logical volume. You can do this using the mkfs command. In this example, an ext4 file system is created on `vol_name_1`:

```bash
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

V. Mounting the Logical Volume

Finally, you mount the logical volume to a designated mounting point using the mount command. This allows you to start storing and accessing data. In this example, `vol_name_1` is mounted at `/mounting_point`:

```bash
mount -t ext4 /dev/TEST/vol_name_1 /mounting_point
```

## Extending a Logical Volume

If you have available space in a volume group, you can extend a logical volume to use that space. This is done using the `lvextend` command:

```bash
lvextend -L +10G /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

This command extends `vol_name_1` by an additional 10GB. The file system on this volume needs to be resized to recognize the additional space:

```bash
resize2fs /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

## Reducing a Logical Volume

To reduce the size of a logical volume, ensure that the volume has enough free space to avoid losing data. First, unmount the logical volume and check it for errors:

```bash
umount /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
e2fsck -f /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

Then, reduce the file system size before reducing the logical volume:

```bash
resize2fs /dev/TEST/vol_name_1 15G
lvreduce -L 15G /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

## Deleting a Logical Volume

You might need to delete a logical volume to free up space in your volume group. Unmount the logical volume and then use the `lvremove` command:

```bash
umount /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
lvremove /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

## Backup and Recovery of LVM Configurations

Taking regular snapshots of logical volumes can be an effective backup strategy. A snapshot is a copy of the logical volume at a certain point in time. It's created using the `lvcreate` command:

```bash
lvcreate -L 1G -s -n snap_vol_name_1 /dev/TEST/vol_name_1
```

This command creates a 1GB snapshot named `snap_vol_name_1` of `vol_name_1`. If a restore is needed, you can revert the logical volume to the snapshot state using the `lvconvert` command:

```bash
lvconvert --merge /dev/TEST/snap_vol_name_1
```

| Feature               | Primary Partition                                     | Extended Partition                                   | Logical Partition                                    | Logical Volume (LVM)                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | A partition that can contain a file system or be used for booting an OS. | A container for logical partitions, not used for direct data storage. | Partitions created within an extended partition.     | A virtual partition created using Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for flexible disk management. |
| **Maximum Count**     | Up to 4 primary partitions per disk.                  | 1 extended partition per disk (occupies one primary slot). | The number of logical partitions is limited by the space in the extended partition and system limitations (up to 128 logical partitions). | Limited by system resources and configuration, practically very high (can easily handle hundreds of volumes). |

| **Storage Capability**| Directly stores data or OS.                           | Does not store data directly; only serves as a container for logical partitions. | Directly stores data, can have file systems.        | Can aggregate multiple physical volumes into a single logical volume, allows complex configurations. |
| **Resizing**          | Limited; generally requires repartitioning.           | Cannot be resized independently; resizing affects contained logical partitions. | Can be resized by adjusting the size of the extended partition. | Easily resizable; logical volumes can be expanded or reduced dynamically. |
| **File System Support** | Supports all file systems.                          | Not applicable as it does not hold data.             | Supports all file systems within the extended partition. | Supports multiple file systems, can have different file systems on different volumes. |
| **Management Tools**  | Managed by standard disk utilities (e.g., fdisk, Disk Management in Windows). | Managed by standard disk utilities alongside primary partitions. | Managed within the extended partition by standard disk utilities. | Managed using LVM tools (e.g., `lvcreate`, `lvextend`, `lvreduce`). |
| **Use Cases**         | Typically used for OS installation, critical system data. | Used when more than 4 partitions are needed on a disk. | Used for separating data, organizing storage without using additional primary partitions. | Used for flexible storage management, creating dynamic and scalable storage environments, advanced features like snapshots and mirroring. |
