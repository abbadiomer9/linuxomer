<h1>What is kernel?</h1>
Operating systems have kernels that manage the CPU hardware, allocate memory, access data and schedule processes. 
They also execute programs and protect them from each other. As soon as a computer starts up, it is the first software to run. 
In order to prevent the kernel's most essential code from being rewritten by other programs running in the operating system, it is loaded into protected memory regions.
