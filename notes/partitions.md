## Partitioning disks

Partitioning a disk means dividing the disk into smaller areas called partitions. Each partition can store different types of data or provide extra storage. There are two main partition tables: MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table).

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Partition        | /dev/sda1        | /dev/sda2        | /dev/sda3       | Free Space      |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Filesystem       | ext4             | ext4             | swap            |                 |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+                 |
| Mount Point      | /                | /home            |                 |                 |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+                 |
| Size             | 50GB             | 100GB            | 8GB             | 42GB            |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```

### MBR (Master Boot Record)

MBR is the older partition table format, used on most computers. It started in March 1983 with IBM PC DOS 2.0. MBR has three parts: the main boot code, a partition table for the disk, and a disk signature. MBR stores its data in the first sector of the disk. It supports disks up to 2TB and can have up to four primary partitions.

### GPT (GUID Partition Table)

GPT is a newer and better partition table format than MBR. It supports disks larger than 2TB and up to 128 partitions. GPT has a Protective MBR and also checks (CRC) values to make sure its data is correct. To use GPT, you must enable UEFI in your computer's BIOS settings.

| Feature        | GPT (GUID Partition Table)                 | MBR (Master Boot Record)           |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Maximum Partition Size** | 18.8 million TB (with 512B sector size) | 2 TB (with 512B sector size)       |
| **Maximum Number of Partitions** | 128 partitions per disk (typically)   | 4 primary partitions per disk     |
| **Data Recovery** | Stores multiple copies of the partitioning and boot data across the disk for resilience. | Stores only one copy of the partitioning and boot data at the beginning of the disk, making it more prone to data loss. |
| **Compatibility** | Supported by newer operating systems and modern hardware (UEFI). | Universally compatible with all operating systems and BIOS. |
| **Boot Process** | Works with UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) which is a modern method of booting. | Works with BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) which is traditional and older. |
| **Partition Scheme** | Uses globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for partitions. | Uses a traditional partition table. |
| **Advantages** | Higher limits on partition sizes and counts, better data resilience, required for modern hardware (like larger hard drives). | Universal compatibility, simplicity, and well-tested over time. |
| **Disadvantages** | Not compatible with older systems that only support BIOS. | Limited partition size and count, less resilient against data corruption. |

### Common Disk Naming Conventions

Disk names in Linux typically follow a specific naming pattern to indicate the type of device, its order, and its partitions. Here's a breakdown:

#### I Device Type Indicators

The first few letters of the disk name indicate the type of device:

- **`/dev/sdX`**: Represents a hard drive using the SCSI or SATA interface. Commonly used in physical servers and virtual machines.
- **`/dev/hdX`**: Refers to an older IDE disk. This type is less common in modern systems.
- **`/dev/vdX`**: Indicates a disk in a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) using the virtio disk driver.
- **`/dev/xvdX`**: Represents a disk in a Xen virtual machine using the Xen virtual disk driver.

#### II Device Order

The last letter before any numbers denotes the order of the device:

- **`/dev/sda`**: The first SCSI/SATA disk.
- **`/dev/sdb`**: The second SCSI/SATA disk.
- **`/dev/hda`**: The first IDE disk.
- **`/dev/hdb`**: The second IDE disk.

#### III Partition Number

Numbers following the device identifier indicate the partition index:

- **`/dev/sda1`**: The first partition on the first SATA disk.
- **`/dev/sdc2`**: The second partition on the third SATA disk.
- **`/dev/hdb3`**: The third partition on the second IDE disk.

#### Additional Remarks

- Modern systems predominantly use the `/dev/sdX` naming convention due to the widespread adoption of SATA interfaces.
- In virtualized environments, `/dev/vdX` and `/dev/xvdX` are commonly used, depending on the virtualization technology.

This naming convention helps to identify and manage disks and partitions in various systems and environments efficiently.

### Looking at partition tables

To look at a disk's partition table, use the gdisk or fdisk command. The gdisk command is for GPT partitions, while fdisk can be used for MBR and GPT partitions. To see all disk partitions, use:

```
fdisk -l
```

Here's an example of what this output might look like:

```
Disk /dev/sda: 240.0 GB, 240057409536 bytes, 468862128 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk label type: gpt

Device       Start       End   Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sda1     2048   1050623   1048576  512M EFI System
/dev/sda2  1050624 468862127 467811504  223G Linux filesystem

Disk /dev/sdb: 1.0 TB, 1000204886016 bytes, 1953525168 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disk label type: mbr

Device       Start       End   Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sdb1     2048 1953525167 1953523120 931.5G Linux filesystem
```

Explanation:

- *Disk Information*: Provides details about each disk (`/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, etc.), including size, sector information, and disk label type (GPT or MBR).
- *Partition Information*: For each disk, it lists all partitions, their start and end sectors, total sectors, size, and type (e.g., EFI System, Linux filesystem).
    
### Making Partitions on a Disk

Creating partitions on a disk allows you to logically divide it into segments, each of which can be used independently. This can be done using either the `fdisk` or `gdisk` command in Linux, depending on whether your disk uses MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning scheme, respectively.

#### MBR Partitioning

To partition a disk (e.g., `/dev/sda`) with `fdisk`:
1. Start `fdisk`: `fdisk /dev/sda`.
2. To create a new partition, press `n`. You'll then be prompted to choose between creating a primary (`p`) or an extended (`e`) partition. Most use cases will require a primary partition.
3. Specify the partition size by entering the starting and ending sectors. You can press Enter to accept the default values.
4. Optionally, set the partition type by pressing `t` and entering the type code.
5. To save the changes and exit `fdisk`, press `w`.

#### GPT Partitioning

For disks with GPT, use `gdisk`:
1. Open `gdisk` on your target disk: `gdisk /dev/sda`.
2. Create a new partition by pressing `n`. 
3. Choose the partition number (1 to 128).
4. Enter the starting and ending sectors, or press Enter to use defaults.
5. Set the partition type by pressing `t` and entering the type code or name.
6. Write the changes to disk and exit by pressing `w`.

#### Important Notes

- **Backup Data** before modifying disk partitions to prevent data loss, as altering partitions can sometimes lead to accidental loss of important information.
- When managing disk partitions, **Resizing and Deleting Partitions** may be necessary if existing partitions occupy the space needed for new ones. To delete a partition, use the `d` command in tools like `gdisk` or `fdisk`. For resizing, you might need to create a new partition with the desired size using the `n` command and then delete the old partition.
- The **Partition Types** you select depend on specific needs, such as using a Linux filesystem or creating a swap space. Each partition type is identified by a unique code or identifier that defines its purpose and structure.
- **Administrative Privileges** are typically required when using partitioning tools, as these actions need root access. Therefore, commands are often prefixed with `sudo` to grant the necessary permissions.

### Changing MBR to GPT using gdisk

Sometimes, there's a need to change a disk from one partition table format to another. For instance, converting an MBR disk to a GPT format can be done using tools like `gdisk` or `parted`. Here's how to do it with `gdisk`:

1. First, check the current partition table of the disk: `gdisk -l /dev/sda`.
2. Backup the current partition table: `sgdisk -b /dev/sda`.
3. Run `gdisk` for the disk: `gdisk /dev/sda`.
4. In `gdisk`, press `x` to enter the experts menu.
5. Then, press `z` to zap (remove) the GPT data structures on the disk.
6. Confirm the action by pressing `y` when prompted about destroying the GPT data structures.
7. Press `n` to create a new GPT data structure on the disk.
8. Confirm the creation of a new empty GPT by pressing `y`.
9. Create the required partitions by using the `n` command in the main menu.
10. After partitioning, save the changes and exit `gdisk` by pressing `w`.
11. Restart the system to ensure all changes take effect.
12. Verify the new partition table: `gdisk -l /dev/sda`.

ðŸ”´ Caution:

- It's crucial to back up any important data before proceeding with this operation, as changing the partition table format can lead to data loss.
- Ensure that your system supports GPT and UEFI (if you're planning to boot from the disk), as older systems with BIOS may not support GPT.
