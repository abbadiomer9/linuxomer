<h1>Why should you learn Linux?</h1>

1. Linux is the future. 

Since its birth (30 years ago), it has seen a continuous growth in business-critical usage, and it is reasonable to assume that Linux will remain the most popular operating system in the foreseeable future.

2. Linux is everywhere.

Most webservers, 99 percent of the world's top supercomputers, numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and Tesla cars all work on Linux. Android is a fork of Linux. Unix-like operating systems include Playstation OS, Mac OS, and OS X.

3. Linux is adaptable.

Your product or service may be built from the ground up leveraging Linux's open-source nature, as well as its modularity. For example, you may install miniature copies of Linux to control the water temperature, adapt it to run on appliances that transport packets over a big business network, or simply use it as your desktop OS.

4. Linux has a strong community and ecosystem.

A large part of Linux's success may be attributed to the strong community and environment that surrounds it, as well as its open source nature. You'll find developers who contribute code to improve the product. There are online forums  and communities, Linux teachers, Linux training courses, Linux blogs, Linux third-party tools, numerous Linux distributions ad Linux conferences.

5. Linux is a great choice for a new business.

A new business can use Linux to run their website, database, and other applications. Linux is a great choice for a new business because it is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to upgrade. It is also easy to deploy and matain applications with Linux.

<h1>History of Linux</h1>

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>1971</code> | First release of UNIX. |
| <code>1983</code> | The GNU Project (which stood for "GNU's Not Unix") was founded in order to develop a fully UNIX-compatible operating system.|
| <code>1987</code> | MINIX, a UNIX-like operating system for students, was released, but its license precluded it from being widely distributed. |
| <code>1991</code> | Linus Torvalds releases the Linux kernel. |

<h1>What is a distribution?</h1>

Distribution is the term used to describe the combination of specific versions of Linux kernel, together with libraries, system daemons, development and packaging tools and life-cycle management utilities that are compatible and tested for interoperability.
Downloading one of the numerous Linux distributions is the most common way for people to get Linux today.
A broad range of Linux-powered devices may be run on Linux-based distributions in addition to servers, desktops, and laptops. Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Cumulus Linux, among others.

<h1>Challenges</h1>

1. What is the difference between a Linux distribution and a Linux kernel?
2. Where can you find a Linux distribution to download?
3. Is Linux the same as UNIX?
4. Is every Linux distribution free?
5. Can anyone see the source code of a Linux kernel?
