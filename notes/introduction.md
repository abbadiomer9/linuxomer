## What is a Distribution?

A Linux distribution combines:
- Linux kernel
- Libraries
- System daemons
- Development and packaging tools
- Life-cycle management utilities

These are compatible and tested for interoperability. Distributions run on servers, desktops, and laptops. Examples include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Cumulus Linux.

## Challenges

1. What is the difference between a Linux distribution and a Linux kernel?
1. Where can you find a Linux distribution to download?
1. Is Linux the same as UNIX?
1. Is every Linux distribution free?
