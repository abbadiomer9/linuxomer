<h2>bashrc</h2>

The <i>\~/.bash_profile</i> file would only be utilized once, at login. Every time a shell is started, the  <i>\~/.bashrc</i> script is read. This is similar to  <i>\~/.cshrc</i>  in C Shell.

The script is designed to be lightweight, with just the most important commands being run.
